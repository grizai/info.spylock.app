Click on the menu icon on the top right of the home screen. Then enter the *"Recovery key"* menu.

You can copy/paste the key by doing a long press on it. Or click on save button on the right of the recovery key and select the app of your choice to save it. You can of course also write it down on a piece of paper.

We strongly recommend that you add a recovery email! If you forget your recovery key, we will be able to send the recovery key at your recovery email.
