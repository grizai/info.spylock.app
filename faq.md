<details><summary>How can I protect against an intruder trying to uninstall my apps?</summary>

The best protection is to use SpyLock as your screen lock by selecting the *"Use SpyLock as screen lock"* option in the settings. This will protect from an intruder getting access into your phone in the first place.

If you sometime lend your phone to friends and are worried they might install or uninstall apps without your consent, we recommend to add the following apps to your protected apps in SpyLock:
- Settings (this will protect the App Settings menu where it is possible to uninstall apps)
- Google Play Store (this will protect the GooglePlay Store were people can install or uninstall apps)
- Package Installer (this will protect a direct uninstall action from the home screen)

If you protect all the packages above, your apps, including SpyLock, will require you to enter your code before they can be uninstalled.

Please let us know at feedback@spylock.app if this procedure does not work on your phone.

A refresher is available by clicking on the question mark icon on the top-right corner of the lock screen. It will guide you through the four key principles about how to use out code-pad.

If you have the app open, or have access to another phone, a detailed tutorial is accessible from the *"Show a friend"* card on the home screen. Click on the card header to expand it and click on the *"Tutorial"* button to start it.
